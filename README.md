# fintech-blockchain-homework

This repository contains custom testnet blockchain, test transaction
and instructions, accompanied with tools and algorithm as part 
of the Fintech homework assignment Unit 18â€”Proof of Authority
Development Chain.

In this homework assignment, we are helping a fictitous bank to
explore potentials for blockchain technology by setting up a private
testnet, which allow for offline development.
 We are using tools and algorithm:

    - Puppeth, to generate genesis block.
    - Geth, a command-line tool, to create keys, initialize nodes,
    and connect the nodes together.
    - The Clique Proof of Authority algorithm - Proof of authority
    (PoA) is a consensus algorithm which is used with blockchains
    that delivers comparatively fast transactions through a
    consensus mechanism based on identity as a stake. It allows
    specific addresses to mine blocks and it is only used for
    development and testing in testnet blockchains.

## Steps to setup custom testnet blockchain

1. **Install MyCrypto Desktop App**
    - Open browser and navigate to the downloads page at https:/
    download.mycrypto.com/.
    - Depending on the operating system, choose the appropriate
    installer.
    - Once downloaded the installer, open the file and follow the
    instruction in the installation wizard.

2. **Install Go Ethereum Tools** 
    - Open your browser and navigate to the Go Ethereum Tools
    download page at https://geth.ethereum.org/downloads/.
    - Scroll down to the "Stable Releases" section
    - Download "Geth & Tools 1.9.25"
    - Decompress the file "geth-alltools-windows-amd64-1.9
    25-e7872729.zip" and rename the folder as "Blockchain-tools".

3. **Running a Proof of Authority Blockchain**
    The Proof of Authority (PoA) algorithm is typically used 
    for private blockchain networks as it requires pre-approval 
    of, or voting in of, the account addresses that can 
    approve transactions (seal blocks).

    - Create accounts for two nodes for the network with a 
    separate datadir for each using geth.
        - ./geth --datadir node1 account new
        - ./geth --datadir node2 account new

    ![Generate Nodes](./Screenshots/generate_nodes.png)
    
    - Copy and save nodes in **accounts.txt** and passwords 
    in **password1.txt and password2.txt** for the furthur use.

    ![Save Nodes Password](./Screenshots/save_nodes_password.png)

    - Generate genesis block
        - Run the command **./puppeth**
        - Given the network name **digiternet**. We can give 
        any network name.
        - Type **2** to pick the **Configure new genesis** option.
        - Type **1** to **Create new genesis from scratch**.
        - Type **2** to choose **the Clique (Proof of Authority)**
        consensus algorithm.
        - Paste both account addresses from **accounts.tx** file 
        we saved previously.
        - Paste them again in the list of accounts to 
        pre-fund. There are no block rewards in PoA, so we'll
        need to pre-fund.
        - Choose **yes** for pre-funding the pre-compiled 
        accounts (0x1 .. 0xff) with wei.
        - Given **ChainID** **4566**. We can give any number.
        - Type **2** to choose **Manage existing genesis** 
        and **export genesis configurations** options.
        - Create files **digiternet.json** and 
        **digiternet-harmony.json**.
        - Delete file **digiternet-harmony.json**.
       
    ![Puppeth configuration](./Screenshots/puppeth.png)

    - Using **./geth**, initialize each node with the new 
    network name **digiternet.json**.
        - ./geth --datadir node1 init digiternet.json
        - ./geth --datadir node2 init digiternet.json

    ![Initilize Nodes](./Screenshots/initialize_nodes.png)

    - Run the nodes in separate terminal windows with the commands:
        - ./geth --datadir node1 --unlock
        "B9c58660c010Ae2f66551ee4f558fB6EC07e1E0e" --mine --rpc
        --allow-insecure-unlock --password password1.txt
        - ./geth --datadir node2 --unlock
        "a63Ca252c5363bdD2bebAAB99c039f8BE3b9cf98" --mine --port
        30304 --bootnodes "enode:/

        --password password2.txt

4. **Send Test Transaction**
    - With both nodes up and running, the blockchain can be added to
    MyCrypto for testing.
    - Open the **MyCrypto** app, than select **Change Network** at
    the bottom left.

    ![Change Network](./Screenshots/change_network.png)

    - Select **Add Custom Node**
    - Network name as **digiternet**
    - Choose **Custom** in the **Network** column
    -  Type **ETH** in the Currency box.
    - In the Chain ID box, type the **4566** as we generated during
    genesis creation.
    - In the URL box type: **http://127.0.0.1:8545**. This points to
    the default RPC port on your local machine.
    - Finally, click **Save & Use Custom Node**.

    ![Custom Node](./Screenshots/custom_node.png)

    - After connecting to the custom network in MyCrypto, Select the
    **View & Send** option from the left menu pane, then click
    **Keystore file**.
    - Next, click **Select Wallet File**.
    - Navigate to the keystore directory inside Node1 directory.
    - Select the file located, provide password when prompted and
    then click **Unlock**.

    ![Keystore File](./Screenshots/unlock_keystore.png)
    - This will open **MyCrypto** account wallet.
    - Looks like we're filthy rich! This is the balance that was
    pre-funded for this account in the genesis configuration;
    however, these millions of ETH tokens are just for testing
    purposes.

    ![Node Balance](./Screenshots/node_balance.png)

    - In the **To Address** box, type the account address
    **0xa63Ca252c5363bdD2bebAAB99c039f8BE3b9cf98** from Node2, then
    fill any amount of ETH.
    
    ![Transaction Send](./Screenshots/transaction_send.png)

    - Confirm the transaction by clicking **Send Transaction**, and
    the **Send** button in the pop-up window.

    ![Transaction Proceed](./Screenshots/transaction_send2.png)

    - Click the **Check TX Status** when the green message pops up,
    confirm the **logout**.

    ![TX Status](./Screenshots/tx_status.png)

    - Click the **Check TX Status** button to update the status.

    ![Transaction Success](./Screenshots/transaction_success.png)

    - Successfully created our own private blockchain.
